# Halt! Hammerzeit.

Hammerzeit is my first foray into writing a game bigger than Frogger or Rush Hour. It will be a 2d RPG complete with sprites, items, tales of heroism and adventure, and perhaps even a small amount of.... eight bit music?? Who knows, man. I also want to add in more complex interactions as I become more comfortable with Easel.js.

#### Why..... Hammerzeit?

Shit needs codenames sometimes. Also it means "Stop! Hammertime." in German.


#### Modules

I'll be writing the game using require.js, backbone.js, and easel.js. There will be a lot of modules. Each "level" shall be its own module.
